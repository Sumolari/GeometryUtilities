# Geometry Utilities

This is a small collection of geometry utilities to work with data in different projections, multiple polygons and polygon overlays.

- Parse `WKT` and extract multiple polygons.
- Convert multiple polygons into single `CGPathRef` to be drawable with `MapKit` as a single polygon.
- Convert from `Mercator` projection and `WGS84` coordinate system.

## Swift 2.2 support

This library supports Swift 2.2 up to version `0.0.6` (included).
